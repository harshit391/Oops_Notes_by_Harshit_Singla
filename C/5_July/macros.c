#include <stdio.h>


// Its like substituting a long set of code with simple enlish word to make the code look better

// Now wherever we want to use long long int data type we can simply write ll to describe it
#define ll long long int

// As we use pie value in our question so to simplify it we can use PI macro which is the subsitution of 3.14159
#define PI 3.14159

// Basically to simplify print we made a function to print something 
// But it is always bounded for specific printing things like this for integer only
#define print(x) printf("%d",x);
